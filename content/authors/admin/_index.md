## About Me

My thesis lies at the intersection of ecology, toxicology, and physiology. I am particularly focused on understanding how low-level and long-term exposure to environmental contaminants, especially toxic metals, affects redox homeostasis and survival in long-lived wild mammals.

I combine field data from individually monitored populations, physiological assays, and statistical modeling to assess the long-term impacts of pollution on wildlife health and fitness.

My main study species is the roe deer (*Capreolus capreolus*), with a focus on two intensively monitored populations in France.
