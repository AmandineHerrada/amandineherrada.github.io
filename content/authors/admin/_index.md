    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

My thesis lies at the intersection of ecology, toxicology, and physiology. I am particularly focused on understanding how low-level and long-term exposure to environmental contaminants, especially toxic metals, affects redox homeostasis and survival in long-lived wild mammals.

I combine field data from individually monitored populations, physiological assays, and statistical modeling to assess the long-term impacts of pollution on wildlife health and fitness.

My main study species is the roe deer (*Capreolus capreolus*), with a focus on two intensively monitored populations in France.
