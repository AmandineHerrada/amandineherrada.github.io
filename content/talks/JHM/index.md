summary: An example of roe deer manipulation recorded by the Haute-Marne journal that wrote about the CMR program in the Trois-Fontaines forest
abstract: 'This studied roe deer population is located in an enclosed forest managed by the French Agency for Biodiversity (OFB). The Trois-Fontaines forest (TF – 1360 ha) is located in north-eastern France (Haute-Marne – 48°43’N, 4°55’E) and is characterized by a continental climate with rich soils, providing a high quality habitat for roe deer. It has been monitored for 50 years through a capture-mark-recapture program. Captures take place every winter for ca. 10 days between December and March. During a capture session, nets are set up to encircle delimited forest areas. Roe deer are then chased to the nets. After capture, they are placed into wood boxes and transported to the handling area where sex and body mass are determined for all individuals. Unmarked roe deer are fitted with ear tags and a tag collar. Only for individuals of known age, we also determine hind leg length and we collect biological material (i.e. blood, hair).'
